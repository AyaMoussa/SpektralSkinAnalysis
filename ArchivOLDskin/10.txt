1) Name the differences betwen sequential, on-line, pattern and stochastic learning mode.








2) How can the back-propagation algorithm improve the output of a neural network?








3) Why do we need an error signal in MLP? Is this an algoritmic enforcement?








4) When do SVMs perform badly, i.e. what are some problems that other learning algorithms might solve more easily?








5) Where to use an ANN? Name some applications which involves ANNs.








6) Why could an ANN be represented by a line equation?








7) Write down and explain Hebb's rule!
