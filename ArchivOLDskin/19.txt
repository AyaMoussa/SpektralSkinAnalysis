1) How is the VC dimension varied when deciding on a network?








2) How do we decide the optimal number of hidden neurons in a network?








3) How can we solve the bias/variance dilemma?








4) Remember the assignment for today, the task about multi layered perception with sigmoid activation function on XOR data. With weights initiated with zeros the neural network learned nothing. Why?








5) Are there any examples of using simulated annealing for moving backpropagation's error function from local minima?








6) What are the benefits of a a artificial neural network?








7) Enumerate some mathematical methods to solve an unconstrained non-linear optimization problem.
