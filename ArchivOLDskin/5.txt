1) What is the difference between evaluation and test our network with test data set?








2) What do we understand by "whitened data"?








3) Explain interpolation vs. approximation in context of machine learning.








4) We have different types of activation functions. In which cases is best to use the corresponding types of activation functions?








5) What is the upper bound of the VC dimension of a Heaviside activation function (in O Notation)?








6) What is the advantage of an MLP over an SVM?








7) Compare: ADALINE and perceptrons!
