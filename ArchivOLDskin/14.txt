1) Define: a hypothesis h from H *SHATTERS* a given data set A








2) Mention how three heuristics can help with back-propagation?








3) Is there a situation where the convergence algorithm might fail to converge, instead, diverge; become unstable? If yes, in which case? (Book, page :121)








4) In error-correction learning, why is the observed output subtracted from the desired output and not the other way round?








5) How do you show the VC dimension?








6) Where to use an ANN? Name some applications which involves ANNs.








7) What is "winner takes it all" learning in SOMs?
